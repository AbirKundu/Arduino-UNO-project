# 🛑 Arduino-Based Gas Leakage Detector Using MQ-2 Sensor

An embedded system project built using **Arduino UNO** and **MQ-2 Gas Sensor** to detect flammable gas leakage (like LPG, methane, butane) in real time. Designed to enhance home and industrial safety by providing immediate alerts.

## 📦 Components Used

- Arduino UNO  
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor  
- Buzzer  
- LEDs (for alert indication)  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard  
- (Optional) LCD Display / GSM Module for extended alerts

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The **MQ-2 gas sensor** detects the presence of combustible gases. When the gas level crosses a predefined threshold:
- 🚨 A buzzer sounds to alert nearby users.
- 🔴 An LED turns on to signal danger.
- (Optional) A message can be sent using GSM module or shown on LCD.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time gas level detection
- Audible and visual alerts
- Compact and low-cost safety device
- Easy to install and use

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Connect components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the code to Arduino UNO via Arduino IDE.
3. Power the board and place it in a location for testing.
4. Simulate gas leakage near the sensor to test the alert system.

## 🌟 Impact

This project improves home and workplace safety, especially in kitchens and industrial zones. It showcases skills in **embedded systems**, **sensor integration**, and **real-time monitoring**.
